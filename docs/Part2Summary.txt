2. Use serialization to store airport subsystem in a file. Similar to displaySystemDetails. Must be in AMS format.
3. Create overloaded createSection in SysMgr to handle layouts. See AMS format for details.
	a. S = [1, ,2] - M = [1,2, ,3] - W = [1,2,3, ,4,5,6,7, ,8,9,10]
	b. Don't allow booking of seats where there is an aisle.
4. All flights between a particular orig/dest must have the same price for equivalent sections within the same airline.
	a. All economy seats across all flights owned by Delta from Seattle to Denver are $300.
5. Book a seat with only a seating preference using only class and preference. Economy + Window or Aisle. If no preferred seat is found, give next available seat in class.
6. Write a GUI
	[done] a. Take in an AMS file and create an airport system.
	b. Seems redundant, but basically perform d, but only within a particular flight and then cascade the change across all flights with the same orig/dest.
	[done] c. Query trips with open seats in a given class with orig/dest and a date.
	    Should list all available trips and prices.
	d. Change seat price across all trips between a particular orig/dest within a company.
